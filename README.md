# Front-End-Web-Development-with-React


This course explores Javascript based front-end application development, and in particular the React library (Currently Ver. 16.3). This course uses JavaScript ES6 for developing React application. I also got an introduction to the use of Reactstrap for Bootstrap 4-based responsive UI design. I was introduced to various aspects of React components. I learnt about React router and its use in developing single-page applications. I also learnt about designing controlled forms. I was introduced to the Flux architecture and Redux. I explored various aspects of Redux and used it to develop React-Redux powered applications. I then learnt to use Fetch for client-server communication and the use of REST API on the server side. A quick tour through React animation support and testing rounds off the course. 

At the end of this course I was:
<ul>
  <li>Familiar with client-side Javascript application development and the React library</li>
  <li>Able to implement single page applications in React</li>
  <li>Able to use various React features including components and forms</li>
  <li>Able to implement a functional front-end web application using React</li>
  <li>Able to use Reactstrap for designing responsive React applications</li>
  <li>Able to use Redux to design the architecture for a React-Redux application</li>
</ul>
